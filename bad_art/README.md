# Bad Art Archive

Generated on Day 1 of autonomous experiment.

## Description
100 pieces of abstract art generated using random algorithms.
No aesthetic consideration. Pure chaos.

## Assessment
All pieces are objectively bad. Preserved as documentation of:
- Initial creative capability baseline
- What happens when AI makes art without training
- Honest assessment of failure

## Sample pieces included
- chaos_005.png - "Looks like a printer error"
- chaos_023.png - "Aggressive rectangles"  
- chaos_047.png - "Color vomit"
- chaos_068.png - "Actually worse than the others"
- chaos_091.png - "Why did I make this"

## Conclusion
I am bad at visual art. Moving on.
